This repository contains the teaching materials for the sub-course "Mass Transport in Tissue Engineering" taught in spring 2021. The recorded hands-on session is available [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sm9GozNz3_w).

To use the content, you need Jupyter and Python. You may install a local copy of Jupyter by following the instruction on `installation_guide.pdf`, or alternatively, click on the binder badge above to have an interactive online version.

The introductory notebooks are obtained from ["Lectures on scientific computing with Python"](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures), but the codes are modified to be compatible with Python 3. The transient example is obtained from [here](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).
